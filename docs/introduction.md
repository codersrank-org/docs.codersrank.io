## Our goal
Telling your developer story is not easy. It is not just a list of work experience or a bunch of code. Some developers like building opensource products, others spend more time on StackOverflow or write articles and of course, many of us mostly write private code. These are very different experiences.
At CodersRank we help you to make this process much easier by aggregating your developer activity from different platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, StackOverflow, LinkedIn and we provide the tools (API, Widgets, documentation, community) to create a profile you want.

## How it works?
### Gathering data
By default after registration CodersRank collects publicly available data from GitHub. Of course, most of the time it is not the full picture but it enables you to have a basic profile based on your public contribution. This is why we created other sources so you can further improve your profile with other activities.

We designed a system that is transparent and secure. Whether you write public or private code we have you covered. Security and privacy is our main concern. For example, data collected from repositories as obfuscated. Usernames, emails and even filenames are hashed. 
#### Automatically
If you want your profile to be automatically updated, then automated integrations will help you. These are the most convenient to use but works only with a limited number of source
#### Manually
If you want more transparency or you use a source that is not supported you can extract data manually. See more about it here.
### Using your data
There are many ways how you can use the existing data. 
1. CodersRank Profile page:
This is the most convenient but less flexible. If you have no time to build your own profile page just use your CodersRank profile.
2. API
The API gives you full control. If you want you can build your own version of your profile page.
3. Widgets
Widgets are nice tools between the first and the second options. Use already existing widgets on your personal website, GitHub profile (see examples) or wherever you want.
